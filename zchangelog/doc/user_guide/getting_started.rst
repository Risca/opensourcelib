Basic usage
===========



Help can be used to find out more about which commands exist and how they are used::

    zchangelog --help

Each command also has it's own help output::

    zchangelog <command> --help

There is also a :ref:`command-zchangelog_help` command to open this user guide::

    zchangelog help user-guide
    zchangelog help <command> # to open the command's page in the user guide


Generating a Changelog
======================

Generate a changelog listing issue summaries between two branches::

    zchangelog --repo [path to zids] changelog --xml changelog.xml origin/release-1.0 origin/release-1.1

This results in a file named changelog.xml in your current working directory, containing the changelog

Generate a changelog listing changes between two release tags::

    zchangelog --repo [path to zids] changelog --xml changelog.xml release-1.0-rc2 release-1.0-rc3

The start and end tags use git rev parse format. If both are specified, the list of commits is
generated by 'git rev-parse start_tag...end_tag'. If only start tag is given, it is passed to rev-parse as is.
