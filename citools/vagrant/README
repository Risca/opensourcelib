This vagrant machine is "hand made" in the sense that it can not be automatically
reassembled. The package target in the make file uses the current active
vagrant and re-packages it for common distribution.

Make sure you have the latest version before you start doing changes to it.

Update the CHANGELOG file describing what changes you have made. For example,
manually configured jobs, updating or installing jenkins plugins, installing
debian packages, etc.
The changelog is copied into the vagrant as part of the packaging and is stored
in /home/vagrant/CHANGELOG

To package the new box run:

  make package

To deploy the packaged box to the vagrant server:

  make deploy

To learn what versions are already deployed:

  make list-box-versions

To learn what next expected version is:

  make list-next-version
