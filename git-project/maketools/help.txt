    install      Install git-project on system
                 defaults to $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)

    uninstall    Uninstall git-project from system
                 defaults to $(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)
                 Uninstall will not delete directories created during
                 installation, even if they are empty.

                 Root destination directory, (default=$(DESTDIR)),
                 can be overridden with DESTDIR=.
                 Prefix, (default=$(PREFIX)), can be overriden
                 with PREFIX=.
                 Bash completion prefix, (default=$(COMPLETIONPREFIX)),
                 can be overriden with COMPLETIONPREFIX=.
                 Path to HTML based documentation, (default=$(HTMLPREFIX)),
                 can be overriden with HTMLPREFIX=.

                 Files that will be installed:
                  * scripts from bin directory:
                      to: $(BINDEST)
                  * man pages from man directory:
                      to: $(MANDEST1), $(MANDEST7)
                  * html-man pages from man directory:
                      to: $(HTMLDEST)
                  * bash-completion script
                      to: $(COMPLETIONDEST)

                 Depending on destination directory, install/uninstall
                 may require sudo.
                 By default, the installation affects git system configuration.
                 This can be overriden by GITCONFIG=--global.

                 The installation parameters is saved with other git-project
                 parameters in git-config. To reuse the existing config for
                 install/uninstall add the argument FROM_CONFIG=y.
                 The value of GITCONFIG will decide witch config to read from.

                 To check the effects of setting different path options,
                 run make help with the options active and the list
                 of paths above will take that into account.
                 Only use alternative paths if you know what you are doing.

    sandbox      If you want to try out (or test) git project with a minimum of
                 hassle, it is possible to create a tiny sandbox project repository
                 with two submodules on local disc. Usage:
                 make sandbox DEST=<path>

                 View the README in console or the userguide for git project for
                 more information about how to utilize the sandbox.
