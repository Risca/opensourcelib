= Getting Started

== Installation

.Zpider is installed from the Zenterio PPA using
----
sudo apt-get install zenterio-zpider
----

The Zpider installation requires Docker to work and will install the docker-ce package.

.To get Docker to work the user needs to be a member of the *docker* group.
----
sudo adduser <user> docker
reboot
----

*The group will take effect after reboot (sometimes a logout/login is enough)*

== Running Zpider

.The easiest way to run Zpider is to
----
cd <documentation_root_directory>
zpider pdf <name of .adoc file>
----

.Example with how to generate a PDF from this User Guide
----
cd documentation/zpider
zpider pdf --output-pdf user_guide.pdf user_guide.adoc
----

Currently it's only possible to store the output file inside the current working directory
because it is generated inside a Docker container that doesn't have access to anything else.
